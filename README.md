# Yan85 with binja

arch plugin in binja i made for fun, and also teach myself about binary analysis backend, as well as how to lift üèãÔ∏è

## why this?

- for fun
- binja did such a great job in doing bring-your-own-arch things :)

## assumptions 

i am living in a beautiful world, where yan85 opcode is not shuffled around... however, i know you might not. but i have a config file for you to suffer yourself. find you own piece of warm in [here](./src/config.json)

## usage

todo.
